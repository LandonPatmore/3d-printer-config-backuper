  This utility will walk you through getting setup with Github to make sure you have a backup of your files in the unfortunate event your machine breaks, spill coffee on it, or a literal blackhole swallows your printer.
  It will also setup your machine to autocommit your printer config on a timed interval (of your choosing).
notice: You assume the risk of running this script. It has been tested heavily, but always be cautious. Create a separate backup of your files if you feel necessary, even though the script does this automatically.
